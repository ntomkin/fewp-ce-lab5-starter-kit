# Lab 5
### Structure/Guide
In Lab 5, we're trying to create a React application from absolute scratch. In Lab 6 and Lab 7, we will
get into using create-react-app, and the building of a typical application. Lab 5 is all about understanding
React on a fundamental level before you implement a toolchain as part of your workflow.

In this example, you start off with a Clock (parent) and ClockDisplay (child). It shows the relationship
between parent and children components, state, and props.
